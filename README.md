In this course I interpreted user needs through the creation of user stories. These user stories were helpful in implementation of the program and they showed what the user wanted from their prespective and were small simple objectives. This helped by giving clear goals of the user needs.
In the future I hope to incorporate something like user stories to my own approach to code development. Having smaller pieces to work on helps with the development process.
Being a good team member in software development means being able to do any job on the team, take accountability for your own work, and to encourage collaboration within the team.
